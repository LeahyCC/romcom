## Overview

People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well ... maybe that's true. We're going to make an app that generates romance novel covers!

## Learning Goals

* Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
* Use a provided class by creating object instances using the `new` keyword
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM

## Technologies Used  

* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML
* Google

## Set Up and Instructions

To begin, go to the GitHub pages deployed site (https://aemiers.github.io/romcom/) to view the project.

To view the code, please go to the GitHub repo (https://github.com/aemiers/romcom).

## Functionality
Users are able to generate a randomized Rom Com book cover simply by clicking on a button. The button click will generate a random cover image, title, and tagline with two unique descriptor words.

If the user finds a cover that they would like to save, they can do so by clicking on the "Save Cover" button at the top of the page. This button will only save a cover if that cover hasn't been saved before. To view their saved covers, simply click on the "View Saved Covers" button.

To delete a cover, the user simply has to double click on the cover they desire to be removed.

A user can also create their own Rom Com cover, inputting their selected image, title, and descriptors

## Future Additions

To further the goal of this project, we would like to -
* Implement data validation and error handling into the form
* When a user single clicks a saved cover, create a modal to view it larger
* Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear

## Progression
